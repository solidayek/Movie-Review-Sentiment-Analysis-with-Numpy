# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Numpy

This project analyzes the sentiment of movie reviews by matching positive and negative sentiment keywords and provides a star rating (1 to 5 stars) based on the sentiment.

How It Works
The program splits the review into words and checks for matches with positive and negative sentiment keywords.

Based on the number of positive and negative keyword matches, it assigns a star rating:

5 stars: Very positive review.
1 star: Very negative review.
You can enter multiple reviews, and the program will calculate an average star rating for all reviews entered.
